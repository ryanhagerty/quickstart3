2. Type `nvm use`
3. Have [yarn](https://code.facebook.com/posts/1840075619545360) installed: `brew install yarn` (using [homebrew](http://brew.sh/))
4. Type `yarn install` to install dependencies and build initial files.
5. Type `yarn start` to start developing!

When ready for deployment, type `yarn build` to build production files.
